# Terraform AWS ALB + EC2 + S3 Demo

This project provisions an **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with two EC2 instances running Apache, fronted by the ALB. Each instance serves a different webpage to demonstrate load balancing functionality. An **S3 bucket** is also created and EC2 instances are given an **IAM role** for S3 access.
